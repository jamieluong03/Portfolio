                    Hello! I am a UCLA Full Stack student seeking a career change to computer science. I graduated from Franklin & Marshall College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biochemistry in May, 2016.
                    Interestingly enough, my college was located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania (basically an Amish reservation). I went from the city/suburban life straight to farmland. It was a huge culture shock to me as that was the first time I've ever left California.. and to live in another state. 
                    <br>
                    Ever since I moved back to La Puente, California, I  worked at a dental office gaining more experiences and building my resume, until it hit me -- that this wasn't what I want. Thus, I decided on a career change. I was always interested in computer science, but because of my passion for dentistry and the time constraint of graduating on time, I couldn't fit any computer science classes in my school schedule. My coding background is little to none, as the only exposure I had was from Myspace. I hope to utilize this course as a stepping stone and hope to acquire  new skills that could potentially help me pursue a path that can combine both coding and biochemistry.
